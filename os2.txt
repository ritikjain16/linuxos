Process Management
        - Thread
        - Signal Handling
        - Scheduling
IPC and Synchronization
        - Data (Pipes, Shared Memory, Message Queue)
        - Synchronization (Racecondition, Critical Section, Locking (Mutex), Semaphores (Signaling)
Memory Management

Process Management:
Process: Running instance of a program
        - Program (passive enetity)
        - Process (active entity)

Single Core CPU
        - Lots of processes would contend for the CPU
        - Context Switching comes in picture
                - Progam Counter value
                - CPU register value
        - Maintained in PCB (Process Control Block)
Evrey process will have a PCB
Every process as a life cycle
        - Ready Queue
