Message Queues:
Collection of messages put up in a queue unless and and untill someone reads it
The messages can be prirotized (How??, please read man page)
Even this can get blocked like pipes, when there is no writer and reader is waiting, when there is no reader and the writer is writing
Unlike pipes, in messages queue we can read messages, not entire queue at the same time
